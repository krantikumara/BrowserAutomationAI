# Automator
Automating UI Automation. Inspired from https://github.com/mayt/BrowserGPT. 
This project allows you to control your browser using natural language. 
It integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 with the Playwright library, enabling seamless browser navigation. 
GPT-4 generates code snippets, which the Playwright executes to carry out specified tasks.

Other sections will be updated soon.
